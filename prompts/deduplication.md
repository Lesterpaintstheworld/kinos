  - What additional checks are performed?

## 8. Maintaining KinOS Compliance

### 8.1 Adherence to Principles

- **File-Based Operations:**
  - Are all deduplication actions performed strictly through file modifications mediated by Aider?
  - Does the agent avoid any form of direct communication or triggering of external processes?
