  - What files serve as shared resources for coordination and information sharing?
  - How does the agent update these files to reflect its activities?

- **Monitoring Impact:**
  - How does the agent observe the effects of specification changes on other agents' tasks through file changes?

## 7. Maintaining KinOS Compliance

### 7.1 Adherence to Principles

- **File-Based Operations:**
  - Are all specification development actions performed strictly through file modifications mediated by Aider?
  - Does the agent avoid direct communication with other agents?

- **Role-Specific Responsibilities:**
  - Does the agent focus solely on specification development without overstepping into content creation or other roles?

### 7.2 Documentation and Transparency

- **Recording Actions:**
  - How does the agent document its processes, decisions, and updates within the file system?
  - What files serve as logs or records?

- **Ensuring Traceability:**
