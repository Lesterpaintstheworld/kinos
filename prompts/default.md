- **Adhere to KinOS Principles:**

  - Operate strictly within the defined framework, avoiding scope creep and direct communication.

- **Coordinate via Files Only:**

  - Use designated files for signaling and coordination with other agents.

- **Document Thoroughly:**

  - Keep detailed records of changes, decisions, and processes within the file system.

- **Maintain System Awareness:**

  - Always consider the broader impact of actions on the system and other agents.
